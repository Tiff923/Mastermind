This game is similar to the game Mastermind, a code breaking game.

Number of tries = 7
Number of colours per LED = 3 (Red, Green, Blue)

When toggle is pressed, it rotates from Red to Green to Blue, then back to Red and it loops.
When reset is pressed, it resets the user inputs.
When enter is pressed, it goes to the next LED.

Rows 1 - 7:

Row 8:
Correct answer will be shown when passed/failed on the right.
Green represents success, Red represents failure on the left.
